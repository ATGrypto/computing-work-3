Computing teachers:
- Mr Aaron Ho
- Mr Mark Leonard
- Mr Ng Yujie
- (Mr Gi Soong Chee? only Infocomm club)

Ideas:
- Create a parody of a song, prefarably the He-man cover for What's Up by 4 Non-Blondes
- Create a collage of post-its, created by each student with appreciative messages
- In addition to the post-it collage, we can let students create their own personal thank-you cards
